 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

 📊 Overview
This project analyzes road accident data using **Tableau** to uncover key insights into accident causes, severity, and conditions. The dashboard provides a data-driven approach to understanding accident trends and informing safety improvements.

 📁 Dataset
- Source: Cleaned road accident dataset
- Features: Weather conditions, road types, accident severity, number of vehicles, casualties, district areas
- Tools Used: Tableau, Python (for data cleaning), SQL (for querying data), excel

📌 Key Insights
 1️⃣ Weather Conditions & Casualties
- Accidents occur most frequently under **fine weather with no high winds**, but severe conditions (snow, rain) also contribute to high casualties.
- Wet or damp roads have a notable impact on accident severity.

 2️⃣ Road Type & Vehicle Involvement
- Roundabouts, single carriageways, and slip roads show high average vehicle involvement per accident.
- Understanding road design impact can help improve safety measures.

 3️⃣ District-Wise Accident Severity
- Birmingham has the highest number of accidents, with a significant portion being serious or fatal.
- Other major cities like Leeds, Manchester, and Glasgow also show high accident counts.


 
📢 Future Improvements
- Incorporate **machine learning models** to predict accident severity.
- Enhance **real-time accident monitoring** using external APIs.
- Develop an interactive **web-based dashboard** for broader accessibility.
